# Poster Pilot — Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
Poster Pilot is a professional-grade, multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform
for indexing and exploring historical poster collections — WPA art, NASA mission posters,
19th-century patent medicine ads, WWII propaganda, and more. It is a Discovery Engine for
visual history. Poster data is sourced via the DPLA API (Digital Public Library of America),
which aggregates holdings from NARA, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian, and other
institutions. The content is still primarily NARA-originated; DPLA is the ingest gateway.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first, no JS config)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 5.x — explicit routing, no heavy abstractions
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector) for metadata storage and semantic retrieval
- **AI/ML**: CLIP embeddings (OpenAI `clip-vit-large-patch14`) for multimodal search
- **LLM**: Claude claude-sonnet-4-6 via Anthropic SDK for The Archivist chatbot
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)
- **Build**: Vite (frontend), tsx/esbuild (backend)
- **Package Manager**: npm workspaces (monorepo: `/client`, `/server`, `/shared`)
- **Deployment**: Railway (Express backend) + Vercel (Vite frontend SPA)

## Architecture
```

├── client/          # React 19 frontend (Vite)
│   ├── src/

│   │   ├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks (use* prefix)
│   │   ├── pages/        # Route-level page components
│   │   ├── lib/          # Client-side utilities

```

Key module boundaries:
- `client/` may NOT import from `server/` — shared types come from `shared/`
- `server/routes/` contains ONLY request parsing and response formatting
- Business logic lives exclusively in `server/services/`
- The Supabase client is a singleton in `server/lib/supabase.ts`

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start both client (Vite) and server (tsx watch) concurrently
npm run dev:client   # Vite dev server only (port 5173)
npm run dev:server   # Express server only (port 3001, tsx watch)
npm test             # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright E2E tests
npm run build        # Build client + server for production
npm run lint         # ESLint across all workspaces
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across all workspaces
```

## Code Style & Conventions

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled (`strict: true` in tsconfig). No `any` types — use `unknown` + type guards.
- Explicit return types on all functions exported from `services/` and `routes/`.
- Use `type` for object shapes, `interface` only when declaration merging is needed.
- All async functions must handle errors explicitly — no unhandled promise rejections.

### Naming
- Files: `camelCase.ts` for utilities/services, `PascalCase.tsx` for React components
- Database columns: `snake_case` (Supabase convention)
- TypeScript variables/functions: `camelCase`
- TypeScript types/interfaces: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- React components: `PascalCase` function names

### Express Routes (Explicit Pattern)
```typescript
// CORRECT — explicit, readable, no magic
router.get('/posters/:id', async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  // validate, call service, respond
});

// WRONG — do not use controller classes, decorators, or IoC containers
```

### Tailwind v4
- CSS-first configuration only — all design tokens live in `client/src/index.css`
- No `tailwind.config.js` — this project uses v4's `@theme` directive
- Use CSS custom properties via `@theme {}` for all colors, fonts, spacing

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: Vitest, co-located in `__tests__/` beside the module under test
- E2E tests: Playwright in `/e2e/` directory
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` (never `.js`)
- Minimum coverage: 80% for `server/services/`
- Every AI feature (CLIP search, Archivist) must have integration tests with mocked API calls
- Run `npm test` before every commit (enforced via pre-commit hook)

## Git Conventions
- **All commits are made manually by the human developer — Claude never runs `git commit`
  or any git write command, and must never be listed as a co-author in any commit message.**
- Branch naming: `feature/short-description`, `fix/issue-description`, `chore/task-name`
- Commit format: `type(scope): description` — e.g., `feat(search): add CLIP vector similarity`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`
- PRs require: passing CI, at least one human review, no TypeScript errors
- Never commit `.env` files or Supabase service role keys

## Guardrails — What NOT To Do
- **No `SELECT *`** — always specify columns in Supabase queries
- **No API keys on the client** — all AI/Supabase service-role calls go through the Express server
- **No magic frameworks** — no NestJS decorators, no tRPC, no ORM magic. Raw SQL via Supabase client.
- **No `any` in TypeScript** — use proper types or `unknown` with narrowing
- **No direct DOM manipulation in React** — use refs or state
- **No catching errors silently** — always log and either re-throw or return a typed error response
- **The Archivist must cite sources** — every chatbot response must reference specific NARA metadata fields; it must NOT fabricate historical facts
- **Confidence scores are mandatory** — every vector search result must return a `similarity_score`; The Human Handoff triggers at `similarity_score < 0.72`
- **Source data is read-only** — this platform indexes poster content from DPLA/NARA; it never modifies upstream records
